    "\n",
    "Python is open source, interpreted, high level language and provides great approach for object-oriented programming. It is one of the best language used by data scientist for various data science projects/application. Python provide great functionality to deal with mathematics, statistics and scientific function. It provides great libraries to deals with data science application.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons why Python is widely used in the scientific and research communities is because of its ease of use and simple syntax which makes it easy to adapt for people who do not have an engineering background. It is also more suited for quick prototyping.\n",

    "# Computing for Everybody\n",
    "As python was becoming popular, Van Rossum submitted a funding proposal to DARPA called \"Computer Programming for Everybody\", in which he further defined his goals for Python:\n",
    "- An easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors\n",
    "- Open source, so anyone can contribute to its development\n",
    "- Code that is as understandable as plain English\n",
    "- Suitability for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times\n",
    "\n",
    "> In 2018, Python was the third most popular language on GitHub, a social coding website, behind JavaScript and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a programming language popularity survey it is consistently among the top 10 most mentioned languages in job postings. Furthermore, Python has been among the 10 most popular programming languages every year since 2004 according to the TIOBE Programming Community Index.\n",

    "# The Zen of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 \"guiding principles\" for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language. Software engineer Tim Peters wrote this set of principles and posted it on the Python mailing list in 1999. Peters's list left open a 20th principle \"for Guido to fill in\", referring to Guido van Rossum, the original author of the Python language. The vacancy for a 20th principle has not been filled.\n",
